I'm a PhD student in the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at the University of Edinburgh. I work with [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/) and [Mark Steedman](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/) on incorporating prosody into NLP models.
